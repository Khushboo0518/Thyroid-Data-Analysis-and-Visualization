# Thyroid-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
📌 Project Title:
Thyroid Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

🔹 Project Description:
This project aims to predict thyroid disease using machine learning models based on medical data. The system takes input features such as TSH, T3, T4 levels, and other patient details to classify whether a person has hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, or a normal thyroid condition.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Model: Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks
Jupyter Notebook for analysis and model training
Git & GitHub for version control
